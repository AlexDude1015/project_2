#### Thoughts

The underlying reason for creating this project is based on
my past observations. I noticed that my classmates and I
were creating projects that nobody wanted to use. It's
so wasteful to put all that effort into something just to
forget about it later.

I asked myself if there was something that could
benefit my classmates and me, and noticed that we were
all panicking about our grades. However, most of our 
assignments weren't graded yet. All that uncertainty was 
frightening and was the root cause of our concerns.

The reason I made this program was to relieve that feeling
and create a clear pathway to achieve for my classmates
and I to reach our desired grade.

the way at the bottom.

Furthermore, the program can calculate
the minimum average grade you will need
to get ace the class. One option determines 
what submitted but ungraded assignments need
to score.

Another option calculates what ungraded and
future assignments need to score. Future
assignments are just estimates. For instance, 
Tweets are assigned every week. So there are 
potentially fourteen of them.
