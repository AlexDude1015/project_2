### Grade Calculator by Alexander Li

---

#### Summary:
Have you ever wondered what you must do to get the 
desired grade in a class? With this program, students can 
get a clear answer.  This program calculates the minimum 
average score of all future and ungraded assignments to get
the desired grade.

#### Implementation:
The program needs several data points to get an accurate
projection. First, the program needs to understand how 
grades are calculated, such as how different types of work
are weighted. Second, it requires the student's current 
assignments and grades. And third, it needs to predict how 
many future assignments will be available based on previous
assignments.
